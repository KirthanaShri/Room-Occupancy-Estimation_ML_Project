# Room Occupancy Estimation

> This project explores room occupancy estimation using ML techniques, analyzing environmental sensor data to optimize energy consumption and space utilization efficiency. Employing Support Vector Machines(SVM), Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks(NN), alongside Principal Component Analysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction, achieved a precision score of 98.7% in occupancy prediction, highlighting the role of ML in smarter infrastructure planning and resource management.


## Data Description
The dataset used in this study originates from the UCI Machine Learning repository and is credited to Adarsh Pal Singh, Vivek Jain, Sachin Chaudhari, Frank Alexander Kraemer, Stefan Werner, and Vishal Garg. The dataset is prominently featured in the research paper titled "Machine Learning-Based Occupancy Estimation Using Multivariate Sensor Nodes," presented at the 2018 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps).
